#
# If you want to use the nanoTeX installation, and its binaries,
# you need to adapt the path, like:
#
#   export PATH=/home/ivan/Documenti/LaTeX/nanoTeX/nanoTeX-master/2020/bin/:$PATH
#
# You can also source the file setup-nanotex, like:
#
#   cd /home/ivan/Documenti/LaTeX/nanoTeX/nanoTeX-master
#   source setup-nanotex
#
# If you run from an editor you can specify the full path to mtxrun:
#
#   /home/ivan/Documenti/LaTeX/nanoTeX/nanoTeX-master/2020/bin//tlmgr update --list
#
# The following settings were used:
#
#   installation directory  : /home/ivan/Documenti/LaTeX/nanoTeX/nanoTeX-master/2020
#   platform                : 
#
PATH=/home/ivan/Documenti/LaTeX/nanoTeX/nanoTeX-master/2020/bin/:$PATH
